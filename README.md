# LatPy

This Python module, named LatPy, is a Python module that provides many lattice algorithms for experiment, implementation, or analytics. For example, lattice reductions, solving lattice problems.

## How to Install

First, you have to install two C++ libraries, that is, NTL library and Eingen library because this module makes use of NTL library and Eingen library in c++ sources.
You can easily install these libraries with ``apt`` command.

```bash
# installs Eigen library
sudo apt install libeigen3-dev

# installs NTL library
sudo apt-get install -y libntl-dev
```
